#Notes

**IMPORTANT**

NOTE: how the same logic of verical order traversal is used
for both top view and bottom view

```
for(auto i: m){
ans.push_back(i.second);
}
```

This is how you should traverse a map and access the first and second elements of it

For pairs ->

```
pair<string, int> p = { “hello”, 1};

p = {“world”, 2};
```
